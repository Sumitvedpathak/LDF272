Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
 $ git init

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
 $ git add .

Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
 $ git commit -m "First commit"

In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
 $ git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
 # Sets the new remote

Check the Remote URL
 $ git remote -v
 # Verifies the new remote URL

Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub if there is a remote branch called master (or main if that's what you're using)
 $ git push origin master
